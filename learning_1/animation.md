# Animation Lesson

# Process Description
- Pygame has a display surface, which is an image that is visible on the screen.
- the image is made up of pixels
- the main way of moving this pixel is by calling blits
  - blit copies pixel from one image to another
  - when you blit an image, you are basically changing the color of a pixel already on the screen
  - therefore blitting makes a copy of an image in a new position
  - erasing the previous image and redisplaying the screen causes an illusion of animation or movement
